This is the repository for my OpenBCI Ganglion firmware and file related to that. I need to write firmware that has 2 maybe 3 modes. I need a button to switch modes.

Mode 1 analuzes the data and toggles an io pin to beep a buzzer to signal certain states for meditation and stuff. I  guess I would need to do fourier transform to analyze the frequency.
Mode 2 will do logging to the sd card.
Mode 3 will do bluetooth, but I don't need this one yet.


Right now the file is a placeholder.
